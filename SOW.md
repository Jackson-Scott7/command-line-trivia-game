Statement of Work (SOW) Socket Programming Project
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Title:

[Command-Line-Trivia Game]

### Team:

[Jackson Scott]

### Project Objective:

[The goal of this project is to provide a command line trivia game that allows for multiple players to play the game at the same time. It should also accurately keep track of each players correct answers and display the winner at the end of the game.]

### Scope:

#### Inclusions:

-   [This project will include a text-based command line interface. A server script written in python and a client script also written in python.]

#### Exclusions:

-   [This project will exclude a web based UI.]

### Deliverables:

-   [Working server.py and client.py scripts. Clean and unique command-line interface. Thorough README.md file that makes it easy for anyone to use the gaem.]

### Timeline:

#### Key Milestones:

-   [Implement TCP server & client](October 6)
-   [Design and Implement message protocol](October 20)
-   [Multi-Player functionality, synchronize states across clients](November 3)
-   [Gameplay, Game State, UI](November 17)
-   [Implement error handling and testing](December 6) 

### Technical Requirements:

#### Hardware:

##### Processor (CPU):
###### Minimum:  A low-end CPU like Intel Core i3 or equivalent will work fine.
###### Recommended: Intel Core i5 or higher for better overall performance and multitasking.
##### Memory (RAM):
###### Minimum: 2 GB of RAM is sufficient for basic Python programs and socket communication.
###### Recommended: 4 GB or higher if you are multitasking or running other applications alongside.
##### Storage:
###### Minimum: Around 100 MB of storage is more than enough for Python and the socket-based trivia game files.
###### Recommended: A few GB of free space for comfort, especially if you plan to add more features or libraries over time.
##### Networking:
###### Minimum: Standard Ethernet or Wi-Fi for basic communication.
###### Recommended: A stable and reliable internet connection if you plan to run the game over the internet (vs. a local network).

#### Software:

-   [Users will need a version python 3.6 or later downloaded, Lib/socket.py library dowloaded, and an IDE like VSCode is recommended. MacOS, modern UNIX, or Windows opperating system must also be used.]

### Assumptions:

-   [Project assumes users have a network connection and all technical requirements have been met.]

### Roles and Responsibilities:

-   [Jackson Scott - Sole project contributor]

### Communication Plan:

-   [I will keep a callendar for myself with the important dates and deliverables that are needed by those dates.]
